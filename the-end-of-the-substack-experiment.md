It turns out Substack is just not a good fit for a programming blog, and I will post further articles at XXXX as long as that continues to work out.

There are many things I like about Substack, the main one that it lowers the barriers to writing. You just open it up and start writing, and Substack takes care of the rest. Removing friction is important. Details:

- Substack keeps everything stored for you, and even saves constantly. You can easily go to another device (I often move from desktop to laptop) and pick up where you left off.

- As you write, you see the finished look. I find this nice for editing, and generally staying focused.

- I don’t have to maintain the software. With Hugo I periodically get maintenance messages, which are especially frustrating if the theme I’m using doesn’t get updates. This is distracting from the writing process.

- Substack will email blog posts to subscribers who want that. While this is nice, I’m not sure it’s essential. Also, if you update a post it only shows up on the web version (even if it’s possible to send updates, I don’t want to annoy email subscribers with those).


When I was writing my [Reinventing Business](http://www.reinventing-business.com/) blog (which I stopped years ago), Substack would have been a great choice, because that was just words. But I’ve realized it is not a fit for a programming blog.

(Here’s a [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-migrate-newsletter-substack-to-buttondown/) that looks at Substack issues, and alternatives. It recommends Buttondown, which supports Markdown).

## Virtually no support for code

Yes, it has a code font and a “code block,” but the only change is the font. And there are no keyboard shortcuts (that I’ve been able to find) for going in and out of these modes; you must select from menu items, which is time-consuming and distracting. I’ve found one unpublished keyboard shortcut, which is if you’re inside a code block and press Ctrl-Enter it pops you out. Are there others? Searching revealed none. The keyboard experience is generally poor, and you are forced to use menus a lot.

There’s no syntax highlighting inside code blocks, and this makes a difference.

## No support for Markdown

I’ve recently experimented with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and it is quite a nice experience. Much nicer for a programming blog than Substack, and everything is in Markdown. This is important because ultimately the material needs to be adapted for Leanpub (in some form—what I’m doing on the blog is basically “research papers” until I discover a through-narrative for the book).

JetBrains just released [Writerside](https://www.jetbrains.com/writerside/) which looks very promising and uses Markdown (plus optional XML if you want to add fancier elements). I’ve heard that it might even support things like automatic code insertion, eliminating the need to build my own tools for that (which I’ve done with my previous books).

I saw an article that claimed you could just paste your Markdown into Substack, but when I tried it virtually nothing worked and I had to fix everything by hand.

Substack will not export into Markdown, so I must hand-fix the exported files. No sense writing more in something that makes me do all that work to get it into Markdown so I can use it where I need it.

## A (low) walled garden

Yes, you can extract your articles, but as mentioned, not in a very useful form. And I’ve discovered that I get nervous relying on Substack to have the only copy of an article I’m working on. With Obsidian you easily place your posts in a Github repo, and Github formats the markdown on its site so it’s easy to give people previews and get feedback (yes, Substack can provide previews, but with Github people can highlight a sentence and send you a link to that sentence, so you don’t have to hunt for what they’re commenting on).

## Programmers are not Substack’s target market

At first I was smitten by how easy Substack was to use, but the issues above eventually made it clear that, for me, Substack removed some friction but then added significant friction in other places. It makes no sense for me to continue here (although if I start writing a non-programming blog again, similar to [Reinventing Business](http://www.reinventing-business.com/) which is just words, I will consider Substack for that).

The blogging experiment will continue at XXXX, for as long as that works out. I will leave the existing Substack posts up.
